Trillions of birds and insects use the airspace for key activities of their life cycle, such as daily foraging movements and seasonal migrations. Their movements link otherwise separated habitats, communities and ecosystems, and have implications for various ecological processes, raise human-wildlife conflicts and provide services (pollination, seed-dispersal, pest control, natureâ€™s contribution to people) and disservices (pathogen dispersal, agricultural damage) that are relevant to human agriculture, economy and health. In the current biodiversity crisis, many bird and insect populations have alarmingly declined while others have increased and cause conflicts. Quantifying their numbers and movements and understanding the drivers of (changes in) their spatiotemporal distribution is key to preserving aerial diversity. Although the airspace is increasingly recognized as an essential habitat for a large proportion of the global biodiversity, aerial habitats are poorly monitored and largely absent from legislation and policy despite their role and degradation having a similar impact on biodiversity and ecosystem functioning like other habitats.
