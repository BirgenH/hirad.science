Trillions of birds and insects take to the air for local or large-scale movements and seasonal migrations. Their movements link otherwise separated ecosystems, raise human-wildlife conflicts, and provide services and disservices that are relevant to human agriculture, economy, and health. Although the airspace is an essential habitat for a large proportion of the global biodiversity, they are poorly monitored and largely absent from policy.

In HiRAD, we will design and implement standardized, automated monitoring of aerial biodiversity by integrating biodiversity information from different radar systems. We will demonstrate the capacity of radars for biodiversity monitoring by creating a unified access point for (WP1) radar data and (WP2) the software tools to analyse them, (WP3) harmonize biological data products from different radars, (WP4) run proof-of-concept studies on birds and insects and (WP5) develop tools for diverse stakeholders from aviation, wind energy, policy makers and others.
