## What is monitoring the airspace important and why so challenging?

Trillions of birds and insects use the airspace for key activities of their life cycle, such as daily foraging movements and seasonal migrations. Although the airspace is increasingly recognized as an essential habitat for a large proportion of the global biodiversity, aerial habitats are poorly monitored and largely absent from legislation and policy despite them playing a similarly important role like other habitats for biodiversity and ecosystem functioning.

Monitoring aerial biodiversity remains a challenge due to the numbers of individual organisms involved, the large scale at which their movements take place and their often nocturnal behavior. Remote sensing technologies such as radar can provide detailed information on, e.g., intensity, timing, altitude, and spatial scale of mass movements for the full range of taxa and all individuals passing through the sensor’s measurement range.

## Radars as remote-sensing tools to monitor the airspace

Currently, various radar systems exist - from **small-scale radars** to large-scale weather radars - that are largely complementary in spatiotemporal and taxonomic resolution and coverage. While small-scale radars (e.g., vertical looking or tracking radars) can identify individual animals and characterize their body shape, wing beat frequency, and other individual characteristics, they only monitor smaller spatial areas. In contrast, **weather radars** survey the atmosphere above many of the world’s large landmasses and are therefore often organized in continental networks (such as NEXRAD in the US or OPERA in Europe), covering regions of several hundred to thousands of kilometers. They also detect biological targets, albeit at coarser spatial and taxonomic resolution.

## How will HiRAD contribute to establishing a monitoring system for aerial biodiversity?

The greatest challenges for establishing weather- and small-scale radars as standardized monitoring system of the airspace are the currently scattered distribution of radar data, biodiversity data products and software tools and the diverse formats of radar data and biodiversity products. In HiRAD, we will address these challenges, demonstrate the value of radar data in monitoring aerial biodiversity - specifically the interaction of birds and insects with biotic and abiotic factors - and create radar-based tools for various stakeholders.

Therefore, we will set up **standardized, automated e-science infrastructure to monitor aerial biodiversity**, to demonstrate its applicability for biodiversity monitoring with high-resolution, spatially explicit proof-of-concept studies for birds and insects, and to develop tools tailored to specific stakeholders. We will thus: provide access to biological data products derived from radar data across Europe (WP1), develop and improve tools for the visualization, exploration and analysis of radar data (WP2), harmonize data from different radar systems (WP3), demonstrate their capacity for biodiversity monitoring of birds and insects (WP4) and provide data products and tools tailored to specific stakeholders (WP5).
